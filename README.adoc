What do you do when your domain model of shared concepts differs from the domain model you want to integrate with?
This tiny project shows a solution for this kind of situations. Using a configuration, a JsonPatch object is created with values from the external model. The patch is applied on our own model.

Current functionality is very limited, because only string values are tested in a flat domain object. This will improve.

List of things to do:

- Add new domain models
- Add more complex mapping
- Add object change
